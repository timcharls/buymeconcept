                    <p>It&#39;s new! it&#39;s fresh! Wait, is it warm in here or is it just me? No It&#39;s a hot commodity! Everyone wants it and those who can get their hands on it must have it. This new product&#39;s popularity makes you want it even more. So what will you do to get it? Youcould wait until the fire goes out, but will the product still be desirable to you then?</p>
                    <p>There are lots of products today that have consumers in a frenzy. The iphone for example is on every corner. Even your mom has one now too, and you don&#39;t? That's not going to fly, so you find a way, any way, to get your hands on it. Although the hot commodity causes raging fire in the market, what happens when the fire dies out? Most products&#39; popularity fades and it becomes obsolete overtime. In some cases, and this often happens with the invention of new technology, the product or device becomes a necessity and with every revision continues to keep fire in the market. </p>
