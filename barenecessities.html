                    <p>After it&#39;s a household name the product becomes a need. Everyone has it, and knows about it. If it has survived the hot commodity phase, a product&#39;s life has potential for increased longevity. It can continue to be facelifted and reintroduced for a new shelf life. In cases like these, the product usually becomes a way of life for consumers. People will continue to purchase the new updated version, because it makes their lives more relevant.</p>  

<p>New products will continue to be created to fill voids, and so the cycle will continue. There are many products that are derived from the invention of another item; they come from human necessity. Think about it, if canned food wasn&#39;t invented for food preservation, would you really have any use for a can opener? A knife could do the same job, but the can opener does it easier. We create new products to fill voids that are not necessarily dire, but fixing them will continue to allow people to become faster and more effecient.</p>
